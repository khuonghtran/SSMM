2. HLS VI file name templet (.gz file)
3. value to be considered as FILL (in each image)
4. length of the VI time series (the same for HLS and VIIRS)
5. x (map coordinates) of upperleft corner of the HLS image in UTM projection
6. y (map coordinates) of upperleft corner of the HLS image in UTM projection
7. UTM zone
8. VIIRS VI file name templet (.gz file)
9. (N) number of VIIRS tiles for fusing the target HLS image (ususally 1, but sometimes 2 or 4)
10. array of horizontal number of tiles (N elements)
11. array of vertical number of tiles (N elements)
12. half window size for searching (number of VIIRS pixels)
13. array of dates for the VI time series
